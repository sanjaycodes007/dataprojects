# dataprojects
contains projects that are implemented using fundamental machine learning concepts
Ideas and intuition from https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/learn/lecture/5733210#announcements This course
Linear regression project-use regression model to find out if a clothing store must prioritize its website or app
Logistical regression project- model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
Random forest-use decision trees and random forest classifier to see whether or not borrowers will pay a company back, compare model performance
30 Day stock price predictor-use SVM and linear regression to predict price of a stock for 30 days
